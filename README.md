# Pendulum Logo

I was bored and wondered how I could make the pendulum logo even more awesome.

This is an early development stage and only tested in Chrome so far.

Credit goes to to [CMA3D](http://cma3d.deviantart.com/art/Pendulum-Logo-181935098) for creating the vector image.

## TODO

- Make all circles go weeeeeeeeee
- Steamline vector paths so the rotation looks better
- use requestAnimationFrame
- Add rotational dependencies between circles so circle edges wont overlap
- Add colors
- Integrate [dancer.js](https://github.com/jsantell/dancer.js)
